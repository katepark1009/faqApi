      "question": "What if I want more than one accreditation for my surgery center?",
      "answer": "It is not uncommon for a surgery center to seek multiple accreditations for either contracting or other business purposes. Everything in our software is dynamic based on the agency that you choose and an additional accreditation usually requires a different tax ID. Therefore, it is important to keep each accreditation in a seperate account with SCT. We\"ve found the best way to accomplish this is by signing up for a new SCT account with a different email address."

      "question": "Can I manage multiple surgery centers on my account?",
      "answer": "We have found it is better to keep each facility in a separate SCT account so there is no confusion. Simply create a new account using a different email address for each facility. If you have more than 2 centers, please contact a sales representative for further assistance."

This will allow your policies and procedures to dynamically capture realtime information about your staff. Do note that adding staff is for record keeping and adding users is for system access."
